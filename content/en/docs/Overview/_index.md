  Findy Agency Overview
---


Findy Agency provides a Hyperledger Aries compatible identity agent service. It includes a web wallet for individuals and an API for organizations to utilize functionality related to verified data exchange: issuing, holding, verifying, and proving credentials. The agents hosted by the agency operate using DIDComm messaging and Hyperledger Aries protocols. Thus it is interoperable with other Hyperledger Aries compatible agents. The supported verified credential format is currently Hyperledger Indy “Anoncreds” that work with Hyperledger Indy distributed ledger.

* you would like to build or use a web wallet for individuals instead of mobile application in your use case
* you want to do experiments quickly without the need to setup or join actual Indy ledger
