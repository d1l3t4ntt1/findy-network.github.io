Findy Agency related documentation to get started with the development. 

**Note**: This documentation does not intend to teach readers theoretical background or other aspects of SSI technology. We expect readers to be familiar with basic concepts of SSI. For self-studying SSI and the technology, we recommend excellent material crafed by other authors:
