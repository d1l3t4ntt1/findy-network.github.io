## Contributor License Agreement

## Pull requests
Use pull requests to contribute code. Pull requests are reviewed through core team before acceptance.

## Issues
Use issues to report bugs or missing features.

## Branches
We use master-develop branch model for submitting
* Master branch stores the official releases of the project
* Develop branch serves as an integration branch for features
* Feature branches are created from the develop branch and merged back to develop after finishing
* Hotfix branches are merged directly to master and develop branches
* Example 1: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow
* Example 2: https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

## Releases
Release scripts are used to create master releases
