Another example of the tree is that
architecture design is included to part of the tree and even to the trunk. As we
see it, it has the internal part of our job. 
we have tried many different versions and styles of the architecture, i.e. how
DID controller communicate with the cloud agent which is the party who is
resonsiple of DIDComm protocols. We always prefer libary over framework -- which
might sound weird.
